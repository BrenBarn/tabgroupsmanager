Whether this add-on is for profit or not for profit, it can be used for free.
As long as this content is not altered in any way, redistribution is completely free.
Altering or leaking the source is forbidden at this time.
However, when it is over-ridden by other add-ons, use of a portion of the code is unlimited.
In this case, users must be prepared to deactivate the over-ride.

This is the end of the license clauses.
I made the license quickly since it has become impossible to upload Firefox add-ons without a license.
Regarding modification to the code, I might either establish sound rules for changing the code when I have the time, or choose another license.
However, the original license is in English, and the court with jurisdiction cannot choose a non-Japanese license. Therefore, as it stands, there is no eligible license.
