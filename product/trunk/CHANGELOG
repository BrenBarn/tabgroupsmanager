- Name: Lastest - TGM 003.
- Version: 2013.08.21.debug.003
- File: addon-2013.08.21.debug.003-fx.xpi
- Changes:
Fixes manual saving and loading session from TGM option Menu.
Fixes loading session when Firefox loads. It will probably fix most horrible session restoring bugs.
Fix to prevent showing two overlapped menu when right clicking a tab (fix by micha).
Minor code fixes to prevent possible bugs.
- Known issues:
DO NOT install Firefox extension: "Classic Theme Restorer". It will break session restoring!!!
Small bug which could open a Start group in other firefox window when manually restoring session.
Still there are minor known issues like not getting good group order or tab order sometimes, or a group not getting back its name.
Restoring could be very slow when having thousands of tabs in windows. In linux it works faster.
There are other critical issues reported, and we will look into all of them. Thank you for your patience.
- Tested with Windows and Linux in FF28 and FF31.
- If TGM 002 works fine for you, do not update.
